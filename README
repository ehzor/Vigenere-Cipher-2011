As a first stab at encryption, I've decided to write a cipher based on the Vigenere Cipher.

This will be an OTP (one-time pad) cipher that uses the benefits of Vigenere Cipher, but also looks to solve issues that are in place with OTP ciphers.  This will be nothing more than a proof of concept, but also hope that it proves useful.

To find more information on this for right now, see the comments in key.h.  When this program is in more of a usable state this README will contain more information.
